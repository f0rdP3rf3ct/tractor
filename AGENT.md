# AGENT.md — Non-Stop Crops

## Project Overview

"Non-Stop Crops" (short name: NSC) is a browser-based isometric farming game. The player drives a tractor or harvester across a scrolling isometric tile grid and collects all crops to win. It is a PWA (Progressive Web App) distributable as a ZIP archive.

The game renders at 800×600 in a Phaser 3 canvas. The world uses a dual-representation model: an invisible Cartesian physics layer drives movement and collision, while a separate isometric render layer handles visuals. The tile grid scrolls infinitely by wrapping Cartesian tile coordinates when they go out of bounds.

## Architecture

### Dual-Representation (Logic + Render)

Every interactive game object has two representations:

- **Logic object**: an invisible `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Image` at Cartesian coordinates. Drives physics/collision. Set `alpha = 0`.
- **Render object**: an `IsoImage` or `Vehicle` (Sprite) at the projected isometric screen position. No physics body.

The conversion is done by `CartesianHelper.getCartesianToIsoCoordinate()`.

### Infinite Scroll

`PlayScene` holds a `cartesianPoints: Point[]` array. Every frame `updateCartesianTilePoints()` offsets each point by `moveDir * MOVE_SPEED`, then wraps out-of-bounds values back to the opposite edge. Both logic and render objects are repositioned each frame from this array.

### State Machine

`PlayScene` implements `StateMachineInterface`. Active states:

```
MenuState → (BUTTON_A) → CountDownState → PlayState
PlayState → (all crops collected) → GameOverState → MenuScene (fresh scene start)
PlayState → (BUTTON_START) → MenuState
```

Each state is a class implementing `State { enter, updateState, exit }`. States own their own `Controls` instance and event listeners. Listeners must be removed in `exit()` to avoid leaks.

### Render Layering

Two `Phaser.GameObjects.Layer` objects within `PlayScene`:
- `groundLayer` — static tile images (ground)
- `renderObjectsLayer` — crops, vehicles (depth-sorted by Y each frame via `updateDepthSortIsometrics()`)

### Vehicle Abstraction

`Vehicle` (abstract) → `Tractor` / `Harvester`. Each subclass defines four animation keys (`ANIM_KEY_MOVE_FRONT`, `ANIM_KEY_MOVE_BACK`, `ANIM_KEY_IDLE_FRONT`, `ANIM_KEY_IDLE_BACK`) and implements `createAnimations()`. The vehicle's `name` is always `'player'` to distinguish it in layer filtering.

### Asset Loading Pattern

- `BootScene` preloads only the UI atlas (needed for the loading screen).
- `LoadingScene.loadAssets()` loads all gameplay atlases and audio.
- Atlas keys are static constants on the class that uses them (`PlayScene.GAME_ATLAS_KEY`, `LoadingScene.UI_ATLAS_KEY`, `InGameUI.INGAME_UI_KEY`).

---

## Development Workflow

### Adding a new vehicle type

1. Create `src/objects/MyVehicle.ts` extending `Vehicle`.
2. Define the four `ANIM_KEY_*` strings and implement `createAnimations()` and `collisionBodySize` getter following the pattern in `Tractor.ts`.
3. Add the new instance to `PlayScene.buildVehicleRoster()` — that is the only method that needs editing.

### Adding a new game state

1. Create `src/states/MyState.ts` implementing `State`.
2. Wire it into the state flow in the appropriate existing state's event listener.
3. Always remove event listeners in `exit()` — `Controls.inputActionEvent` is not auto-cleaned.

### Adding assets

1. Export spritesheets from TexturePacker to `assets/spritesheets/` (JSON Hash format, PNG atlas).
2. Load in `LoadingScene.loadAssets()` using `this.load.atlas(KEY, png, json)`.
3. Define the atlas key as a `static` constant on the class that owns it.

### Debug physics view (dev only)

Press `F1` during gameplay to toggle visibility of the Cartesian physics bodies (crops and player logic objects). Only available in dev builds (`npm run dev`). Controlled by the compile-time `DEBUG` flag injected via webpack `DefinePlugin` in both webpack configs — all debug code is dead-code-eliminated from the production bundle and the `cartDebug*.png` assets are excluded from `dist/game.zip`.

Runtime toggle lives in `src/misc/DebugConfig.ts`. The `IS_DEBUG` constant is read at module load time; `togglePhysicsBodies()` flips the runtime state. `PlayScene.toggleDebugView()` applies the updated alpha to all objects in `collisionGroup` and `logicPlayer`.

### Validating changes

- Build TypeScript: `npm run build` (production) catches type errors.
- Dev preview: `npm run dev` then open `http://localhost:5555`.
- There is no automated test suite — validate by running the game in a browser.

---

## Coding Standards

### Naming

- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g. `PlayScene`, `CartesianHelper`)
- Files: `kebab-case` for scenes (`play-scene.ts`, `boot-scene.ts`), `PascalCase` for objects/states/misc
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for static class members (`GAME_ATLAS_KEY`, `ANIM_KEY_MOVE_FRONT`)
- Private instance fields: `camelCase` with `private` modifier
- Interfaces: prefixed with `I` (`IImageConstructor`)

### TypeScript

- `noImplicitAny: true` — all parameters must be typed.
- Use Phaser type aliases at the top of file with `import X = Phaser.Y.Z` (see `play-scene.ts` for pattern).
- Avoid `any` unless interfacing with Phaser internals that require it (e.g. `onPlayerCollision` params).

### File Organization

- One class per file.
- Interfaces in `src/interfaces/`.
- Stateless coordinate/math helpers in `src/misc/`.
- Game object classes in `src/objects/`; abstract base classes in `src/objects/base/`.
- State classes in `src/states/`.

### Comments

- Section dividers in long files use `/* --- SECTION NAME --- */` blocks (see `play-scene.ts`).
- JSDoc only on non-obvious utility methods (`CartesianHelper`).
- Do not comment obvious code.

### Error Handling

No explicit error handling exists beyond TypeScript's static checks. There is no runtime error recovery. Do not add try/catch unless integrating with an external API.

## Testing Requirements

**There is no test suite.** Manual browser testing is the only validation path.

Before completing any task:
1. `npm run build` must succeed with zero TypeScript errors.
2. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5555` to manually exercise the changed behavior.
3. Verify the full game flow: Boot → Loading → Menu → Countdown → Play → Win → Menu.

---

## Commands

```bash
# Start dev server (also compiles first)
npm run dev
# Dev server: http://localhost:5555

# Production build → dist/ + dist/game.zip
npm run build

# TypeScript type-check only (no emit) — useful for quick validation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Agent Rules

1. **Follow existing patterns first.** Before introducing a new abstraction, check whether `CartesianHelper`, `Controls`, `Vehicle`, or the state machine already solve the problem.
2. **Atlas key constants belong on the class that owns them.** Do not use string literals for atlas/frame keys inline.
3. **Always remove event listeners in `exit()`.** `Controls.inputActionEvent` listeners accumulate across state transitions if not removed.
4. **Never edit the `.js` siblings** of `.ts` files (`game.js`, `config.js`, etc.). They are stale artifacts.
5. **Dual representation is required for new interactive objects.** A logic `physics.add.image` (invisible) + a render `IsoImage` or `Vehicle` (no physics body) — not one object doing both.
6. **New vehicles must be added to `buildVehicleRoster()` and must implement the `collisionBodySize` getter.** Missing either causes silent incorrect behavior.
7. **New scenes must be added to `GameConfig.scene` array in `config.ts`** in the correct boot order.
8. **Do not modify `dist/`** — it is a build artifact.
9. **Do not add test infrastructure** unless explicitly requested.
10. **Keep scope minimal.** This is a small game with no abstraction layers beyond what exists.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Isometric Y-sorting must stay** in `updateDepthSortIsometrics()` — removing it causes vehicles to render under/over crops incorrectly.
- **`moveDir` coordinates are inverted from intuition**: moving "right" sets `moveDir.x = -1`; moving "left" sets `moveDir.x = 1`. This is intentional — the grid scrolls opposite to the player's apparent movement direction.
- **`collisionGroup` members carry a `cartesianIndex` data key** that links them to `cartesianPoints[]`. This index must be preserved when creating new objects via `logicObject.data.set('cartesianIndex', index)`.
- **`IsoImage.name === 'player'`** is used to skip the player during render updates in `renderObjectsLayer`. Any new render object that should scroll with the grid must NOT set `name = 'player'`.
- **Audio objects must not be created before `LoadingScene` completes.** All audio is loaded in `LoadingScene.loadAssets()`; instantiating a `Sound` before that throws.
- **The inner blank area (`INNER_MOST_BLANKS_TILE_SIZE = 9`)** is intentional — it creates a clear center where the player spawns without crops.
- **Production build uses `webpack.production.config.js`**, not `webpack.config.js`. The dev config does not copy assets or generate `index.html` — it serves from the project root statically.
- **`console.log` statements exist in production paths** (`Tractor.ts`, `CountDownState.ts`). Remove them when touching those files rather than adding more.
